// crates/qbzd/src/events_bridge.rs — bridge playback-driver edges onto the
// CoreEvent bus.
//
// The 450 ms playback driver detects track/play-state transitions
// (`DriverAction::ReportEdge` -> `deps.on_edge`), but nothing translated those
// edges into the playback CoreEvent variants the bus consumers were written
// for: mpris.rs and scrobble_engine.rs both carry TrackStarted /
// PlaybackStateChanged / PositionUpdated / VolumeChanged arms that never
// fired, and `/api/events` (SSE) / `qbzd watch` carried no playback traffic at
// all. This task closes that gap: it wakes on the same edge Notify pulse the
// QConnect report scheduler uses (with a 2 s poll fallback, because
// `plan_tick` only reports edges while a track id is present — a stop that
// clears the track id would otherwise go unseen), reads the live player state,
// dedups against what it last published, and sends the delta to the bus.
//
// Holds only a Weak<AppRuntime> (upgraded per wake, dropped before the next
// wait), so it sits outside the #521 audio-release ordering — the caller
// aborts it for a clean shutdown, same as the queue-persist subscriber.
